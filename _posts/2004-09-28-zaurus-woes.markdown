<p>If you are trying to reflash a zaurus 5500 to the Sharp Rom, and see an error message a little something like this: Couldn&#39;t find ext2 superblock, followed by a request for you to enter maintenence mode with a little <span class="caps">CTRL</span>-D action -- pull the CF card out and do a hard reset. You&#39;ll be back in business in no time.</p>
