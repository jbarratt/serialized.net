<p>We just got back from a great weekend in Mammoth. I&#39;d never been there before, but it was well worth the trip. My only beef from the whole weekend was that on Sunday, even with bad weather and over 60% closed lifts, they didn&#39;t offer vouchers or partial refunds or anything other than a "tough rocks."</p>

<p>The one thing I am considering for our next multi-day snowboard trip, however, is some form of more robust sun protection. I&#39;m thinking along the lines of a stylish full-face graphic rendered in non-toxic latex paint... even with sunscreen I got a brutal burn, and it was way too hot to wear full-face coverage.</p>
