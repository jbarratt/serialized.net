<p>We just arrived at the lovely Sofitel in Philadelphia, where we'll be spending the evening. I just checked the stats display on the <span class="caps">GPS </span>(I reset the counters before we left) and thought I'd share:<br />
Total Miles Driven: 2,382.63<br />
Total moving time: 46:42</p>

<p>Also, we both finished the new Harry Potter book (thanks to the drive from Northern Maine to Ithaca, NY for the time to finish them up.)</p>
