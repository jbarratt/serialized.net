title: Transparently rating iTunes tracks with Quicksilver
wordpress_url: http://wp.serialized.net/?p=120

<p>I was recently asked about what music I was liking now-a-days by a friend bemoaning the lack of musical cross-pollination since leaving the hallowed halls of our <a href="http://ucla.edu">Alma Mater</a>. </p>

<p>"Well, easy, sir!" I chortled, pulling up a quick search for my &#39;starred&#39; music in iTunes. Hm. Out of 5573 tracks, I&#39;d bothered to star about 10. </p>

<p>I ended up sending him to my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jbarratt/">last.fm profile</a> but I&#39;ve realized that there&#39;s not a lot of relationship between &#39;music I think is awesome&#39; and &#39;music I listen to frequently.&#39; Because my normal mode is &#39;shuffle&#39;, and I have (see above) 5573 tracks, what shows up in last.fm is more or less randomly weighted by how many tracks I have from a given artist, and is no metric of quality.</p>

<p>So, I decided to rate more music. The problem is, I listen to music in the background and don&#39;t want to bother myself pulling up itunes, finding the track playing now, deciding how many stars to give something, clicking that slot, and going back to what I was doing. Not going to happen. In fact, searching a bit for this problem, I found that <a href="http://www.lowest-common-denominator.com/2007/10/itunes_quicksilver_if_you_like.php">this blog article</a> perfectly captured both my annoyance at the star system <span class="caps">AND </span>provided the perfect solution. </p>

<p>So now if I like a track, I just pull up quicksilver with some magic that only my fingers remember (cmd-space iirc) and type what&#39;s already turned into just &#39;in...&#39; and boom, I bump the stars up by one.</p>

<p>Here it is, in action:<br />
