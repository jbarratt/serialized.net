<p>A friend just called and asked me what my wireless network&#39;s named. "Um, &#39;boing&#39;? Why?" It turns out he was at a coffee shop about a mile from my house and his laptop had picked up an AP named "BarrattNetwork". He thought I&#39;d just borged together a Mighty Antenna and might be Wisping or something. That&#39;s amazing though -- my name&#39;s pretty rare in this country.</p>

<p>In more wifi news, I just set up a pretty neat rig. I needed a wireless-&gt;wired bridge that had a decent antenna. I looked around at the products that they sell as "gaming adaptors", and they didn&#39;t seem to be very controllable. I ended up picking up the Linksys <span class="caps">WRT54GL </span>and a nice directional high-gain antenna for $75 total, $25 less than one of those other &#39;lesser&#39; adaptors. One quick flash with OpenWRT later, and I&#39;ve got 4 live network ports bridged over to any AP I care to point my antenna at. Very nice.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> It worked <span class="caps">AWESOME </span>when we installed it. Even from way inside the building the connection seemed rock solid, and we got great download speeds from it too.</p>
