<p>I&#39;ve been working with <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xnee/">xnee</a> to do regression tests on a <span class="caps">GUI </span>application. I kept running into a problem though -- when I played back an xnee session, it would play back fine -- but afterward, my X session would behave really strangely. Trying to type &#39;ls&#39; into a terminal would cause it to exit or clear the screen or other odd behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>I heard back from hesa, xnee&#39;s author, who said this will be fixed in the next release. Good to hear...</p>
