title: Awesome perl module for sending mail

<p>I found a perl module today which made me disproportionately happy; thus, I decided to share.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/MIME-Lite-3.020/lib/MIME/Lite.pm"><span class="caps">MIME</span>::Lite</a></p>

<p>Check out, specifically, the example of sending email "with images attached".</p>

<p>I'm now able to quickly blast myself summary emails including exciting things like visual maps of the data, etc. I'm sure the evil amongst us would appreciate this tool for <em>other</em> reasons, but we'll ignore the evil for now.</p>
