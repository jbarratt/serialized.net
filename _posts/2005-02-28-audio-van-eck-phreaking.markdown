<p>As I was typing last night, I realized each of the keys on my keyboard (which is nice and loud) probably have a unique acoustical signiature. And if I did some audio processing on my laptop microphone, which is sitting right next to it, I could probably (with some degree of accuracy) determine what keys I was striking with no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST">electrical malarkey</a> at all!</p>

<p>So today I stumbled across this: <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004704.php">"Sensitive Objects".</a> These guys take small sensors (accelerometers) and place them on any flat surface, and detect the unique acoustical signature produced when any section of the surface is touched.</p>

<p>I wonder if I could do a dirt-cheap version of this just by monitoring the input of a microphone with my computer? The detection would be very complex because you'd have to detect a given signature regardless of ambient noise. Additionally, if (say) you were using your desk, I suspect the signatures would change based on the location of other objects on the same surface. (If you have a laptop there or not, for example.) It would be a really interesting way to get some extra inputs to your computer, but I'm quite sure that it wouldn't be worth the <span class="caps">CPU </span>cycles to do it. Anyway. Just tickled by the thought, I guess I'll leave it at that :)</p>
