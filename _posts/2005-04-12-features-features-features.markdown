Hehe, I love marketing garbage. I'm looking for a new laptop for work with some specific features we need.<br />
These really help me narrow it down:<br />
<blockquote>
Features:<ul><li>Sparkle with impeccable style</li><li>Lighten up and relax</li><li>Shine with brilliant performance</li><li>Blaze ahead with the hottest</li></ul>
</blockquote>
Well. As long as I can blaze ahead with the hottest, that laptop will do me just fine. Only sissies care about, oh, graphics chipsets and screen resolution.
