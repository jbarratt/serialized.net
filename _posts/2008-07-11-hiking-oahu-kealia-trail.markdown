<p>So we spent a few hours on the awesome looking <a href="http://backyardoahu.com">Backyard O'ahu</a> but found over and over that the great looking hikes were all either illegal or needed advance permission to use. Bummer. So we found the <a href="http://oahuhiking.com/kealia.htm">Kealia Trail</a>:, nice and close to our rental home on the North Shore, and did a nice early morning punch.</p>

<p>A view from near the top:</p>

<p>I shot a couple of panoramas, too, and stitched them up with <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a></p>

The workflow to produce this data is a little bumpy, so I'm documenting it so I can remember it for myself, and presumably it'll be interesting for someone else as well.<br />
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Garmin eTrex Vista HCx</li>
<li>Mac running Leopard</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Save the track on the <span class="caps">GPS</span></li>
<li>Connect to your computer and use <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=3886">Garmin Bobcat</a> to import it.</li>
<li>Load it in Google Maps. Drill down into your data set and turn off everything but the "path"</li>
<li>Right-click your <strong>path</strong> (very important) and say 'email'. (Sounds nuts, but it's the only export function I can find?) Drag and drop the file out of the email that got created and throw the email itself away.</li>
<li>Upload the kmz file to some hosting somewhere.</li>
<li>Go into Google Maps and search for the <span class="caps">URL </span>of that <span class="caps">KMZ </span>file.</li>
<li>Choose 'Link to this Page' ... 'Customize and Preview embedded map'.</li>
</ol>
