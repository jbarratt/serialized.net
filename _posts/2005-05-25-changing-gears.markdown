<p>So I&#39;ve been pretty busy recently, mostly because I <a href="http://conceptoverdrive.com">switched</a> <a href="http://mediatemple.net">jobs</a>. Media Temple had a need that I was able to fill, so I&#39;ve returned there and it looks like it should be fun.</p>

<p>Part of the fun is the new building (mt)&#39;s moving to soon, "the box."<br />
<a href="http://www.ericowenmoss.com/box.html">Exterior</a><br />
<a href="http://www.davidbartle.com/new_office_panoramic1.jpg">Interior</a> (warning, large panorama!)</p>

<p>Anyway, lots of fun. As soon as I get back into a schedule of sorts with the new job, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have new and fascinating things to be posting again :)</p>
