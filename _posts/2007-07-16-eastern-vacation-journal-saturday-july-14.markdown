<p>We head to the airport. Note to self -- you get what you pay for. We found cheap tickets through <a href="http://airtran.com/">AirTran</a> and, apparently, so did everyone else. <img src="http://serialized.net/images/2.jpg" alt="Airtran Logo" class="left" style="float:left" /> They had 2 gate agents, one of whom was busy with one annoying girl the entire time we were there -- and a line stretching pretty much the entire length of the terminal. We made it aboard, but were not comforted when, waiting to actually get on the plane, a young lady got off, escorted by a flight attendant, as "my seat and my whole row just fell apart." In any case, the flight was otherwise uneventful.  Arriving in Atlanta we could see why it was popular -- LA must be an incidental destination for them. They pretty much owned the whole concourse over there.</p>

<p>The rental car was an interesting situation -- turns out, at some airports, National only has "compact" cars, even though they advertise "economy" and "compact." <img src="http://serialized.net/images/3.jpg" alt="" class="right" style="float:right" /> Since we&#39;re driving so much, and there&#39;s only the 2 of us, I was saying "tinier is better" and signed up for the economy. I was expecting a dinky Chevy Aveo -- and got this lovely beast instead. (In other words, you get a compact for the economy price, since they don&#39;t technically "have" any economy cars.) While yellow is not my first choice in car color, it&#39;s fun to drive, has <span class="caps">XM, </span>a line-in input for the ipod, a sunroof, and gets 32MPG. I was very pleasantly surprised when my first fillup was $30.</p>

<p>Ah yes, as you can see, our first meal was at the Waffle House, apparently an institution around here -- you see the signs at pretty much every off ramp. I&#39;d seen them when I was in Georgia for my brother&#39;s wedding, and we didn&#39;t get a chance to sample. We&#39;re all about absorbing the local culture on this trip, so we gave it a shot. It was tasty food, no doubt! They do make a very good hash brown.</p>

<p><strong>First stop:</strong> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=maggie+valley%2C+nc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=35.659528%2C-83.373871&amp;spn=0.614796%2C1.218109&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">Maggie Valley, NC</a></p>

<p>Our first real destination was the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsm/">Great Smoky Mountains National Part</a> , so Maggie Valley was a good nearby spot to get a hotel. It seemed to be a kind of family vacation kind of place -- the smokies seem to be entirely filled with hotels, mini golf, and more hotels. <img src="http://serialized.net/images/4.jpg" alt="Chillin on the porch with the rockers" class="left" style="float:left" /> Notably, Best Westerns appear to have really top quality wireless internet for free. I found this amusing since the 2 of the last 3 hotels I&#39;ve stayed in (a) cost 3 times as much as this and (b) charged $10 for mediocre wifi. </p>

<p>As it happens, Amber and I are both fans of the mini golf, so we walked down the street and took in a game. (Had we felt like it, we could have visited 3 more such facilities in less than a mile.) </p>

<p>The surroundings are incredible in that part of the country for a native Californian. From the minute we got in our car, even driving close to downtown Atlanta, the whole world was <span class="caps">GREEN </span>in a way that&#39;s pretty foreign to us. Even in our national parks, things tend to be green in kind of a scrubby, piney kind of way. Here there are large, broad-leaved, lush looking trees growing on top of other broad-leaved, lush looking trees and the whole thing appears to be covered in some kind of ivy, just in case there weren&#39;t enough broad green leaves to go around.</p>

<p>So, travel-weary, we brought our first day to a close, readying ourselves for the driving and scenery that tomorrow would bring.</p>
