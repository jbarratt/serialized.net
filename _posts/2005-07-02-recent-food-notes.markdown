<p>I&#39;ve been cooking a suprisingly large amount recently, considering how (otherwise) busy I am. I think it&#39;s a coping mechanism. Rather than dish on the details of full meals, I&#39;ll hit a few highlights.</p>

<ul><li>I have a new favorite mashed potato trick. After mashing and seasoning to taste, dump into a baking dish, top with a hard cheese, then toss under the broiler until crispy. Slice, scoop out of the pan, and serve as crispy-topped squares. Got Amber&#39;s coveted "best mashed potatoes ever" rating.</li><li>I&#39;m going to have to spend more time with Mario Batalli&#39;s recipes. The sauce in <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/cooking/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_17632,00.html">this recipe</a> blew my mind. Dates, reduced balsamic vinegar, anchovy paste, olive oil, thyme and red wine marry explosively well together.</li><li>I picked up some grassfed bison steaks from Santa Monica Farmer&#39;s Market. (It&#39;s a new stand.) De-licous. I liked it more than Amber did, she would have preferred the equivalent cut (New York) of cow. It made me want to try some grassfed beef!</li><li>I very much enjoy the wines of <a href="http://www.qupe.com">Qupe.</a></li></ul>
