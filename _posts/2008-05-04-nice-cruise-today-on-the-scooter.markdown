I had some time this afternoon, and it was a nice day, so I decided to take the scooter out for some exploring. We live right next to Pacific Palisades, and I've never really headed over there, so figured 'why not.' It ended up being 35 miles! There's some really gorgeous views to be had around there, and what look like some great (and accessible) trails which are an easy trip for us to get to.

In the future I would wear a jacket, no matter how warm it seems. Got a bit chilly.

I had the GPS under the seat recording the tracklogs, and here's the results:
