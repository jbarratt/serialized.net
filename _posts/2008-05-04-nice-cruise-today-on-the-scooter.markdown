<p>I had some time this afternoon, and it was a nice day, so I decided to take the scooter out for some exploring. We live right next to Pacific Palisades, and I&#39;ve never really headed over there, so figured &#39;why not.&#39; It ended up being 35 miles! There&#39;s some really gorgeous views to be had around there, and what look like some great (and accessible) trails which are an easy trip for us to get to.</p>

<p>In the future I would wear a jacket, no matter how warm it seems. Got a bit chilly.</p>

<p>I had the <span class="caps">GPS </span>under the seat recording the tracklogs, and here&#39;s the results:</p>
