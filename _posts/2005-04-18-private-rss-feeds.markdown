<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about private <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds quite a bit recently. I&#39;d like to get more and more information (server stats, account balance warnings, etc) that I just don&#39;t want to share with other people. Also, I&#39;d be nice to provide things like that to &#39;customers&#39;. Say I want to subscribe to my amazon "where&#39;s my stuff" &#39;feed&#39;. (They don&#39;t build one yet, but they should!) Then all my tracking info and all my internal package moves inside amazon would all just pop up in the feed reader. But hey, not everyone should be able to subscribe to my amazon "where&#39;s my stuff" feed. (I <strong>would</strong> like people to be able to subscribe to my &#39;wishlist feed&#39;, that would be cool.) Anyway, all of that stuff should be able to run over <span class="caps">SSL </span>and with some kind of authentication. The problem is mostly in the feed readers -- which ones work with Auth or <span class="caps">SSL </span>or Both?</p>

<p>The web is great.<br />

<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=149">Livejournal</a> has another method, in the <span class="caps">URL </span>with a digest auth<br />
Things that use <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001973.html">magpie <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> (like my aggregator, <a href="http://feedonfeeds.com/">Feed on Feeds</a><br />
And so forth. Cool.</p>

<p>You know, I bet with Amazon&#39;s web services (in particular) I could do all that stuff I was discussing. In fact I bet it&#39;s been done before. <a href="http://blog.kevindonahue.com/archives/2004/01/displaying_amazon_wi.php">Yes.</a> Yes it has.</p>
