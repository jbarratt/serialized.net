<p>In Ithaca, we arrived after a 10 hour long haul across the wilds of rural Maine and upstate New York to find probably the nicest bed and breakfast I&#39;ve ever stayed in. I&#39;m glad we took the scenic route -- it was a a slow, winding drive, but the hundreds of miles of postcard-like farmyard were worth it. I kept wanting to stop the car and set up some shots, but there was always something in the way of the landscape -- a car, a fence, a telephone wire -- it wasn&#39;t quite worth (a) pulling off into someone&#39;s driveway and (b) hopping a fence -- maybe if we had a few less than 10 hours to drive that day. In any case, if you ever find yourself in Ithaca, or the finger lakes in general -- stay at the William Henry Miller Inn. </p>

The wonder that was lime-infused watermelon.</p>

<p>The bed was incredibly comfortable, the innkeepers friendly and helpful, and the food fantastic. At 8pm they set out the dessert bar -- all from-scratch made items, fantastic. #1 best feature of the room, though -- huge whirlpool tub for 2. Breakfast was great too, lime-infused watermelon followed by our choice of a pecan crusted french toast or a omelette roulade -- both were great. On top of that the inkeepers were totally helpful -- they had directions printed out to all the local things worth seeing and would make recommendations based on our preferences. We ended up going to the impressive Ithaca Falls, a short walk from the inn, and then onto the Cornell Campus and their art museum. It was a decent museum, running on a pretty limited basis because it was the summer semester, but the view from the 5th floor was amazing -- the whole city of Ithaca and Cahuga Lake. </p>

Ithaca Falls, loving the Tv+Tripod, am right guys?</p>

Is it possible for us to be mature adults? Probably not. Would I want it any other way? Probably not.</p>

<p>We liked Ithaca -- it&#39;s probably the college-towniest college town I&#39;ve ever been to. Dinner was great, too, a little tapas-style place, "Just a Taste". They had a cool thing I&#39;ve never seen before -- flights of wine. You&#39;d buy 5 3oz pours all grouped by theme -- "Spanish Reds" or "Sparkling" or "Big Reds", etc. It was neat to be able to compare and contrast similar glasses next to each other. Oh, and the food was fantastic.</p>

Philly not taking itself too seriously -- the founding fathers, ipod style.</p>

<p>After leaving Ithaca, we headed to Philadelphia. I got a deal at the Sofitel, the nicest straight-up hotel I&#39;ve ever stayed at. The design was clean and modern and awesome, with a bed so comfortable we never wanted to get out. Room service served up a mean creme brulee, as well. Our view was nothing special -- overlooking a lot of grotty rooftops -- but for what we paid vs what we got, no complaints from me. Philly&#39;s an interesting city. It&#39;s a true metro, meaning downtown driving was a bad idea and not a lot of fun. We walked a lot, both the evening we arrived and the next morning. It&#39;s a lot less interesting and inspiring to see things like the liberty bell and the original congress building than I thought it would be. Architecturally, the city&#39;s a bit of an enigma. It has some incredible structures downtown (especially City Hall, dominating Penn Square just a few blocks from our hotel) but they&#39;re tarnished by everything being dirty and run-down looking. You walk through an otherwise spectacular arch and there&#39;s a mesh above you just inexplicably filled with gum wrappers, cigarette butts, and other crud.</p>

A monster cheesesteak.</p>

<p>The real bright spot was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Terminal_Market">Reading Terminal Market</a> -- full of incredible food and people who care about it. I got an &#39;authentic&#39; cheesesteak from one of the stalls recommended on Chowhound by a local, and Amber got a really good selection of antipasto from a Salumeria. My sandwich was pretty large, and by far the best of it&#39;s kind I&#39;ve ever had. (As you&#39;d expect/hope, it being the home of it&#39;s genre, of course.)  The best word for it (and what set it apart from others I&#39;ve tried) was &#39;balanced&#39;. There was a far smaller amount of meat and cheese than I expected, but it was a perfect amount when set against the fresh-that-morning italian roll. </p>

<p>In other news, I&#39;m going to be fasting for 20 days once I get home. This trip has not been a step forward on my path towards fitness, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Updates will probably slow down or stop from here on out -- we&#39;re staying with friends and family, much less "vacationing" in the tourism sense. We&#39;ve both concluded that we got full value of the "vacation" already, and everything from here on out is just a bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Note: thanks to the awesome verizon 3G card for allowing this post to be published doing 60MPH on the <span class="caps">I95 </span>south of Philly.</strong></p>
