<p>A lot of times when I&#39;m home (especially during the summer) I&#39;d like some iced coffee. However, I&#39;d never figured out a good way to turn hot coffee (which I shamelessly make the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_10020,00.html">Alton Brown way</a>) into cold coffee quickly. In a pinch, I can always use a coctail shaker, which does the job -- but that means I&#39;m watering down the coffee to the tune of 4-6 ice cubes which are usually totally melted by the time shaking&#39;s done.</p>

<p>The solution? I keep the colder-than-ice sleeve to my ice cream maker in the freezer all the time anyway. The sides of it are very conductive and (because that&#39;s their job) good at transferring heat out of the liquid inside the bowl very quickly. So while it&#39;s still in the pot, I stir in sugar and milk, then toss it into the sleeve. Stir for a moment, then let it sit for a minute or three -- and viola, chilled, full strength coffee.</p>

<p>The only downside to this process is that the bowl was really not designed to have liquids poured out of it. I had to do it over the sink and it still made a bit of a mess. Other than that, success! Any day you can convert a unitasker into a multitasker is a good day.</p>
