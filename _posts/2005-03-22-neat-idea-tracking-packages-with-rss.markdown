<p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/03/16/ups-rss.html">This article</a> describes a way to dump package tracking information from from <span class="caps">UPS</span>/FedEx/... into an <span class="caps">RSS </span>feed. Package tracking is a good application for <span class="caps">RSS </span>-- I&#39;d love a nice interface on it, too. You  highlight a tracking number in your browser, click a bookmarklet, it&#39;s added to your &#39;queue&#39;, and then any changes to the package pop up in your aggregator amidst the flow of other data you&#39;re consuming. As soon as the package is listed as &#39;Delivered&#39;, it can be taken out of the list of packages to check on.</p>

<p>There are lots of sorts of information that fits the <span class="caps">RSS </span>paradigm better than the email paradigm. I&#39;d love it if email was left to only be things that for sure needed my attention. Things that I should glance over if and when time allows (daily server status reports, build logs, filtered weather information, ...) could all be published via <span class="caps">RSS.</span> Any application where there is allowable slop in if (1) you read it at all and (2) when you read it. Another tool for the toolbox....</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Hey, <a href="http://bloglines.com">bloglines</a> just added this as a feature, you can inline package tracking information into your feed. Sexy!</p>
