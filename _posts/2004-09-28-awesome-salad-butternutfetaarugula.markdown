<p>Amber found a recipe for a quick, simple, and amazing salad the other day that we whipped up. I&#39;m a big fan of it so thought I&#39;d post the directions:</p>

<p><u>Butternut Squash, Feta and Arugula Salad</u><br />
1 Medium butternut Squash<br />
Arugula (1 bag)<br />
Crumbled Feta (1 container)</p>

<p>1) Peel and cube the squash into approx 3/4" cubes.<br />
2) Toss in a roasting pan (or 2, the squash should be all in 1 layer) with olive oil, then salt and pepper to taste.<br />
3) Roast in a 425 oven until crispy but not burnt. (35-40 mins) In retrospect, tossing around partway through would have been a nice addition.<br />
4) Toss with the feta and then toss in the Arugula. Serve.</p>

<p>We had a gap between 3 and 4, so I reheated the squash in a microwave just before assembling and serving. It seemed for sure like you&#39;d need some kind of dressing, but between the oil the squash had on it, the squash itself, and the melting feta, the whole thing was a great blend between soft/crispy and sweet/savory.</p>

<p>In a related note, we really need a digital camera.</p>
