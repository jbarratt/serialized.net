<p>Amber and I adopted 2 kittens this weekend. They&#39;ve both had a rough start in life so are a little (ok, a lot) slow to warm up to humans. We&#39;re sure that with enough <span class="caps">TLC </span>they&#39;ll be great cats -- they both show signs of being very smart and curious. As soon as they get a little more sociable I can probably have them pose for more flattering photos -- (sorry about the orange-eye) -- but for now this will do to introduce them.</p>

<h3>Gwen</h3>

She&#39;s a <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/selector/profile.jsp?id=4080">Tonkinese</a> mix, as best they can tell. She&#39;s the fiesty one -- she likes to unleash a cute rumbly little growl when you are intruding on her space. We also found that she crawls into our bed, waaay under the covers, for snuggly little naps -- so if you come and visit, do the &#39;pat test&#39; before you sit on the bed.

<h3>Misha</h3>

Misha&#39;s a <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/selector/profile.jsp?id=3020">Korat</a> mix (again, as far as we can tell.) She&#39;s the braver one, happy to sit out in the middle of the floor and actually look at us, instead of always sneaking around the baseboards.
