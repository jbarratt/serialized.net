If you<br />
<ol>
<li>Have a web server with MySQL and <span class="caps">PHP</span></li>
<li>Read sites that have <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds on a semi-regular basis</li>
<li>Ever use different computers, or can't find a desktop aggregator you like...</li>
</ol>
do yourself a favor and install <a href="http://feedonfeeds.com/">Feed On Feeds.</a><br />
<p>
The only notes I have:<br/><br />
Do use the auto-subscribe bookmarklet.<br/><br />
Don't forget to set up a cron job to update the feeds.<br/><br />
Don't forget to htpasswd protect the directory -- every link you click will have your FoF install as the Referrer <span class="caps">URL.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I think the thing I like best about having an aggregator is that I can happily subscribe to infrequently updating sites <i><strong>cough</strong> <strong>cough</strong> like this one</i> and I just get to see all the updates when they hit my browser. Subscribing to a weblog no longer means having to troll it (in)frequently for updates that might not be coming.</p>
